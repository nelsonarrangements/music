            <p>Nelson Arrangements was started in 2022 with different piano compositions and arrangements of various
                pieces being primarily hymns from the LDS Hymnal. As time went on, multiple different forms and styles
                were created and used to arrange pieces to be something they weren't before. Some of these styles and
                variations include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Solo Piano</li>
                <li>Alternate Versions</li>
                <li>Mashup Versions</li>
                <li>Ragtime Versions</li>
                <li>Organ Solos</li>
                <li>Holiday Arrangements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As of 2023, the Remastering Project had begun with optimizing the audio quality of the different
                arrangements by rerecording and modifying to increase their overall sound and impact.</p>
            <p>As of late 2023, the Sheet Music Project has started where sheet music is being made for the different
                arrangements starting with the Ragtime Versions. Release date for those will be announced at a later
                date.</p>
