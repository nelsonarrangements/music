        <h4>April 2, 2024</h4>
        <p><b>Sheet Music Project Updates</b></p>
        <p>As of April 2, 2024, there are 3 Ragtime Version piano arrangements available for download via the sheet music section of the Nelson Arrangements website. The project has been slow moving as acquiring new software proved difficult as well as time constraints. Starting late April 2024, more sheet music will be produced at a more rapid rate [around 1 - 2 sheet music PDFs will be produced per month as some arrangements are more complex than others].</p>
        <p>Each of these will be posted under their corresponding genres page on the Nelson Arrangements website. For those that want to request certain sheet music PDFs for a sooner release, email <i>nelsonarrangements@gmail.com</i> with the title of the arrangement desired.</p>
        <p><b>YouTube Content Updates</b></p>
        <p>Content is uploaded to YouTube at a mostly consistent rate [roughly around 1 upload per two weeks]. There are a total of around 180 different and unique arrangements, but as time goes by these will all be posted on the YouTube Channel, as well as the Nelson Arrangements website.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your continuous support with the YouTube Channel and utilizing the website albeit with a few bugs.</p>
        <p>- Garrett Nelson</p>
